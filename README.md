The automotive industry has been growing at a rapid pace, and the focus has been on developing more fuel-efficient, environmentally sustainable, and technologically advanced vehicles. With the increase in competition and change in consumer preferences, it has become crucial to understand the factors that drive car demand. Electric and hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity, and alternative fuel sources like hydrogen and natural gas are also becoming more popular. Gasoline-powered cars are still the most dominant, with varying fuel types and grades available. To make better decisions regarding pricing and product development, car manufacturers can analyze the relationship between features, market categories, and pricing, identifying popular and profitable categories.

Data analysis techniques, such as regression analysis and market segmentation, can help manufacturers develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability. This approach can enhance competitiveness and profitability over time while focusing on product features for future development.
